# Ann Arbor Tour Guide App

This is an app with multiple screens, each of which lists a kind of attraction for a given city, national park, or historical monument. 

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Planning your app design and navigation before coding.
* Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
* Building layouts to display those lists of data.
* Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.
* Creating your own custom classes.
* Properly handling images or audio (if applicable).

Requirements:
* App contains at least 4 lists of relevant attractions for a location
* User can navigate between lists using a central screen, a NavDrawer, or a View pager.
* Each list item contains information about an event, restaurant, historical site, or similar.
* At least one list includes pictures of the location.
